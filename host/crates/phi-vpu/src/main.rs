//! `phi-vpu`: hand AVX-512 work to the card's vector units and get the
//! answer back.
//!
//! The host writes its data into the shared window, fills in a request,
//! rings the doorbell, and waits for the card's reply. The card runs the
//! program's own AVX-512 arithmetic, translated to its instruction set
//! ahead of time, on as many vector units as asked.
//!
//! ```text
//! phi-vpu status                      is a worker polling?
//! phi-vpu poly --n 1048576 --threads 57 --repeat 5
//! phi-vpu matmul-check              every weight format against the host, and rates
//! ```
//!
//! `poly` checks every returned lane against this host's own fused
//! multiply-add hardware before it reports a speed, because a fast wrong
//! answer is worth nothing.
