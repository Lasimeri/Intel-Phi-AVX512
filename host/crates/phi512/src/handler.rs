// The low 128 bits of every zmm register are an xmm register, and the low
// 256 bits are a ymm register, and both of those are **real hardware on
// this host**. An AVX or AVX2 instruction touching them executes natively
// and never faults, so nothing here ever sees it.
//
// A program mixes the two constantly. A horizontal reduction is the
// ordinary case:
//
//     vextracti64x4 ymm1, zmm2, 1     AVX-512: faults, handled here
//     vpaddd        ymm0, ymm0, ymm1  AVX2: runs on the real registers
//
// If the emulator kept its own copy of ymm1, the second instruction would
// read the hardware's ymm1, which the first never wrote, and the answer
// would be silently wrong. So the low 256 bits are not imaginary at all:
// they are read out of the signal frame before each instruction and
// written back after, and only bits 256 and above of zmm0 to zmm15, plus
