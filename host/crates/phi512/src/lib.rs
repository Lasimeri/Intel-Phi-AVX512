//! `phi512`: let a program built for AVX-512 run on a machine that has none.
//!
//! The program is not modified, not recompiled, and not aware of this. It
//! executes an AVX-512 instruction, the processor refuses it, and the
//! handler here performs the instruction instead and lets the program
//! carry on.
//!
//! ```text
//! LD_PRELOAD=libphi512.so ./a-program-built-for-avx512
//! ```
//!
//! # The register file is imaginary
//!
//! This host has no `zmm` registers at all, so there is nowhere to keep the
//! values the program believes it is computing with. They live in
//! [`VState`] instead, a plain array. That works only because it is
//! *complete*: the program cannot read a `zmm` register except through an
//! AVX-512 instruction, every one of those faults, and every one of those
//! is serviced here. Nothing else in the process can observe the
//! difference. If a single AVX-512 instruction were executed some other
//! way the illusion would break, which is why anything unrecognised is a
//! hard failure rather than a skip.
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! A fault costs about 1909 ns on this host, measured, which is roughly
//! 1900 times the instruction it replaces. That is the price of the
//! *first* execution of each site only: because an EVEX instruction is at
//! least 6 bytes and a near jump is 5, a site can be rewritten in place
//! once its translation exists. See `docs/research/avx512-transparency.md`
//! for what each stage costs and where this is going.
