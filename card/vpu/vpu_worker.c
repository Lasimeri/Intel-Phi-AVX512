/* phi-vpu-worker: the card side of the AVX-512 co-processor.
 *
 * Stays resident, polls a doorbell in host memory, and when work arrives
 * runs it across the card's vector units. The kernels it runs are AVX-512
 * machine code translated to this card's own instruction set ahead of
 * time by host/crates/avx512-xlate, so what executes here is the
 * program's own arithmetic, not a reimplementation of it.
 *
 * Data moves through the block device rather than the mapping, because
 * the mapping is uncached and streams at 50 MB/s while the DMA engine
 * behind the block device does 1.2 GB/s. See vpu_proto.md.
 *
 *   phi-vpu-worker [-v] [-s MS] [-i US] [threads]
 *     threads 1 to 228 (57); spin MS after a job before parking (200);
 *     once parked, poll the doorbell every US microseconds (500)
 *
 * The threads are created once. Creating one costs about 0.58 ms on
 * this card, and the first version of this worker created and joined
 * them per request, so that 57 threads took 34.9 ms to do 1.85 ms of
 * work. Every thread in the pool is pinned to its own hardware thread
 * at start-up and stays there.
